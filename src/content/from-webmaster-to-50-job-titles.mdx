You know that feeling when you stumble across an old website and there's a little "Webmaster:" credit at the bottom? Just a name and an email address?

I love those.

Back in the early 2000s, when I first discovered the web on my iMac over a 56k dial-up connection, that was *the* role. The webmaster. One person who did… everything:

- Wrote the HTML (by hand, obviously)
- Designed the layout
- Wrote all the content
- Set up the hosting
- Answered the support emails

If you had feedback, you just emailed them. There was a single human you could point to and say: *"They made this."*

I find that kind of beautiful, honestly.

## Then Everything Exploded

Over the next couple of decades, the web got ambitious. Sites turned into apps. Static pages became dynamic, personalised experiences. Suddenly the web wasn't just a digital brochure—it was *the* channel.

And with that ambition came… job titles. So many job titles.

What used to be "the webmaster" fragmented into:

- Frontend engineer
- Backend engineer
- UX designer
- UI designer
- Product designer
- Content designer
- SEO specialist
- DevOps / SRE
- Analytics engineer
- Performance engineer
- Accessibility specialist

And that's just scratching the surface.

Each new layer of sophistication brought more tools, more abstractions, more configuration. We traded one generalist for dozens of specialists and a *lot* of handoffs.

The tradeoffs?

- **Longer feedback loops.** Designer hands over Figma. Developer builds it. QA tests it. Product reviews it. Rinse, repeat.
- **Less ownership.** Very few people touch the whole experience anymore.
- **More complexity.** The stack itself becomes its own problem domain.

## 2025: Vibe Coding and the Pull Back Toward One

Fast-forward to now.

After a year of AI-assisted "vibe coding" going mainstream, something interesting is happening. I was listening to the *Dive Club* podcast the other day, and it clicked:

> Writing code as a profession is evolving. Again.

AI tools can now scaffold projects, generate components, wire up APIs, and suggest sensible defaults for routing and state. They don't *replace* engineering—but they compress the skill stack you need to get working software on the screen.

This has some fun consequences:

1. **One person can ship more.** You can go from idea to running prototype fast, without memorising every CLI flag.
2. **Roles start to overlap again.** A designer with some coding literacy plus AI help can implement a lot on their own.
3. **The "webmaster" concept re-emerges.** Not literally, but the spirit of "one person owns the whole experience" is suddenly back on the table.

Where we spent two decades splitting one role into fifty, we're now seeing a gentle gravitational pull back towards **consolidation**.

## Tools That Feel Like the Old Web (The Good Parts)

This shift isn't *just* about AI. It's also about the tools we choose.

One reason I love **Svelte** is that it feels like a modern version of the old "just write HTML/CSS/JS" mindset:

- Single-file components where markup, styles, and logic live together
- Compilation that strips away runtime overhead
- Minimal boilerplate compared to most JS frameworks

It gives me the sense that *I'm in charge*, not the build pipeline. That's weirdly refreshing.

**htmx** gives me similar vibes:

- Declare interactions directly in HTML with attributes
- Progressively enhance server-rendered pages without shipping a megabyte of JavaScript
- Mental model: *render HTML, sprinkle behaviour*. Not *re-implement the browser*.

With tools like these, you can choose **deliberate complexity** instead of accidental complexity. You add weight when you need it, not by default.

## npm Hell and Regaining Some Control

We've all been there:

- Pages that ship multi-megabyte bundles for… a button and some text
- A 600-line library pulled in for a three-line helper
- Dependency trees where nobody can explain why half the registry is involved

AI and vibe coding aren't a magic cure. But they *do* shift the power dynamics:

- You can ask for simpler solutions—and actually get them
- You can refactor fearlessly, because the tedious parts can be offloaded
- You can prototype multiple approaches quickly and pick the one that's actually sane

Not a solution. But definitely **more control**.

## The New Webmaster Mindset

We're not going back to footer credits that say "webmaster: someone@isp.com". But the *mindset* is quietly returning:

- **Holistic ownership.** Caring about design, implementation, performance, and maintainability as one coherent story.
- **Tool literacy over tool worship.** Picking Svelte or htmx because they fit, not because they're trending.
- **AI as leverage, not a crutch.** Using vibe coding to accelerate *judgment*, not replace it.

The stack is still complex. The industry is still specialised. But the idea that one person can have meaningful, end-to-end impact on a web experience?

Surprisingly alive again.

And for those of us who enjoy thinking about both pixels *and* code? These are pretty exciting times to be building for the web. 🙃
