In the early 2000s, when I first discovered the magic of the web on my iMac over a dial-up connection, most websites had a little signature at the bottom: **“Webmaster:” + a name**.

That person was everything in one:
- They wrote the HTML.
- They sliced and designed the layout.
- They wrote the content.
- They configured the server and hosting.
- They answered support emails.

If you had feedback about the site, you emailed the webmaster directly. There was a single human you could point to and say: *“They made this.”*

Over the next two decades, that role blew apart into a small industry’s worth of job titles.

## The Explosion of Roles

As the web matured, expectations exploded:

- Sites turned into apps.
- Static pages became dynamic, personalised experiences.
- Businesses started to depend on the web as a primary channel, not just an online brochure.

What used to be “the webmaster’s job” fragmented into:

- Frontend engineer  
- Backend engineer / API engineer  
- UX designer  
- UI designer  
- Product designer  
- Content designer / UX writer  
- SEO specialist  
- DevOps / SRE  
- Analytics / growth engineer  
- Performance engineer  
- Accessibility specialist  

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

The needs grew, and they were booming. Each new layer of sophistication added more tools, more abstractions, more configuration. We traded one full-stack generalist for dozens of specialists and a lot of handoffs.

The cost:  
- **Longer feedback loops.** Designers hand over Figma; developers translate it; QA tests it; product reviews it.  
- **Less ownership.** Very few people own the experience end-to-end.  
- **More complexity.** The stack itself becomes its own problem domain.

## 2025: Vibe Coding and the Return of Consolidation

Fast-forward to **2025**. After a full year of AI-assisted “vibe coding” going mainstream, something interesting is happening.

Listening to the *Dive Club* podcast the other day, it clicked for me:  

> Writing code as a profession is evolving again.

AI tools can now:
- Scaffold projects.
- Generate components.
- Wire up basic APIs.
- Suggest sensible defaults for state management and routing.

They don’t replace engineering, but they **compress the skill stack** needed to get working software on the screen.

This has a few consequences:

1. **One person can ship more.** A motivated individual can go from idea to running prototype fast, without memorising every build tool and CLI flag.
2. **Roles start to overlap again.** A designer with some coding literacy plus AI assistance can implement a lot on their own.
3. **The concept of “webmaster” re-emerges—just upgraded.** It’s not the same as in 2000, but the spirit of “one person owns the whole experience” is back on the table.

Where we previously split one role into fifty, we’re now seeing a gentle gravitational pull back towards **consolidation**.

## Tools That Feel Like the Old Web (In a Good Way)

This shift isn’t *just* about AI. It’s also about the kinds of tools we choose.

One of the reasons I love **Svelte** is that it feels like a modern expression of the old “just write HTML/CSS/JS” mindset:

- Single-file components with markup, styles, and logic together.
- Compilation that removes a lot of runtime overhead.
- Minimal boilerplate compared to many JavaScript frameworks.

It gives me the sense that **I’m in charge again**, not the build pipeline.

Similarly, **htmx** gives me hope for a simpler web stack:

- It lets you declare interactions directly in HTML using attributes.
- You can progressively enhance server-rendered HTML without shipping a massive SPA.
- It encourages a mental model that looks a lot like the old web: *render HTML, then sprinkle behaviour*, not *ship a megabyte of JavaScript and re-implement the browser.*

With tools like Svelte and htmx, you can choose **deliberate complexity** instead of accidental complexity. You add weight when it’s needed, not by default.

## npm Hell, Multi-MB Pages, and Regaining Control

We’ve all seen it:

- Pages that ship **multi-megabyte bundles** for trivial UI.
- Dependency trees where you pull in a 600-line library for a three-line helper.
- npm package nesting hell, where nobody can fully explain why a button click pulls in half of the registry.

AI and vibe coding are not a magic cure for this, but they *do* shift the power dynamics:

- You can **ask for simpler solutions** and get alternatives that don’t drag in three extra layers of abstraction.
- You can **refactor fearlessly**, because the tedious parts—updating callsites, adjusting types, regenerating boilerplate—can be offloaded.
- You can **prototype multiple approaches** quickly and choose the one that’s actually sane, not the one that was easiest to wire up the first time.

Again: not a solution, but **more control**.

## The New Webmaster Mindset

We’re not literally going back to the footer credit “webmaster: someone@isp.com”. But the *mindset* is returning:

- **Holistic ownership**: caring about design, implementation, performance, and maintainability as one coherent story.
- **Tool literacy over tool worship**: picking Svelte, htmx, or whatever else because it fits the problem, not because it’s the default on Twitter.
- **AI as leverage, not a crutch**: using vibe coding to accelerate judgment, not to replace it.

The stack is still complex. The industry is still specialised. But the idea that **one person can have meaningful, end-to-end impact** on a web experience is surprisingly alive again.

And for people who enjoy thinking about both pixels *and* code, these are exciting times to be building for the web.
