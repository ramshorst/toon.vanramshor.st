Remember webmasters?

In the 2000s, most websites had a little credit in the footer. One name. One person who did *everything*:

- Page layout and visual design
- HTML, CSS, and whatever JavaScript was fashionable that year
- Content writing
- Hosting, deployment, tech support

The webmaster owned the whole experience. How it looked, how it worked, how fast it loaded over a wobbly dial-up connection.

Then, slowly, that role fragmented into a parade of specialisations. Design became its own silo. Engineering became its own silo. Handoffs everywhere.

But here's the thing: in 2025, something's shifting again.

> The **designer–engineer hybrid** is quietly becoming the new power role.

Not a pure designer. Not a pure engineer. Someone who thinks in terms of interaction, aesthetics, and user journeys—*and* can express those ideas directly in working code.

## How We Lost the Full-Stack Designer

As web apps got more complex, the industry optimised for scale. Fair enough. But it came with tradeoffs.

- Design tools went from Photoshop → Sketch → Figma
- Engineering went from PHP templates → SPAs → micro-frontends
- Infrastructure went from shared hosting → containers → serverless

Handoffs multiplied:

1. Designer produces static mockups
2. Engineer translates them into React, Angular, or Vue
3. Product reviews and asks for tweaks
4. Repeat forever

Somewhere in this loop, designers lost direct access to the actual medium. They started drawing *representations* of interfaces instead of working in the real material: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The result?

- Designers felt their intent diluted
- Engineers became gatekeepers of "what's possible this sprint"
- Tiny changes required a full trip through the pipeline

Frustrating for everyone, honestly.

## 2025: Vibe Coding Changes Everything

With AI-assisted workflows, "vibe coding" has become a real thing. And it's kind of magical.

- You describe the interaction you want
- You paste a rough layout or component structure
- The model generates a first pass in your framework of choice

This dramatically lowers the activation energy for **designers who code a bit** and **engineers who care about design**.

Instead of: *"I need a frontend engineer to translate this Figma file."*

You get: *"I can ask my tools to generate something close and tweak it myself."*

The designer–engineer hybrid can now:

- Iterate on real components, not static mockups
- Validate interactions and motion directly in the browser
- Ship prototypes that actually behave like the final product

The pipeline collapses. Handoffs shrink. And the person with the clearest vision for the experience can move the fastest.

(This is my favourite part, honestly.)

## Why Svelte and htmx Fit This Role So Well

Tools matter a lot here. Two that fit the hybrid mental model beautifully are **Svelte** and **htmx**.

### Svelte: Feels Like Enhanced HTML

Svelte is weirdly close to the web's native materials:

- **Markup first.** You write HTML-ish templates with minimal ceremony.
- **Scoped styles.** CSS lives right next to the component it belongs to.
- **Reactivity without boilerplate.** State just… updates. No hooks, no lifecycle gymnastics.

For a designer who codes—or an engineer with strong design instincts—this is huge:

- The distance between layout, interaction, and styling is tiny
- You open one `.svelte` file and see the whole picture
- It doesn't feel like wrestling a framework; it feels like enhanced HTML/CSS/JS

### htmx: Design in HTML

htmx goes even further:

- Declare dynamic behaviour directly in your markup (`hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-swap`)
- Lean on server-rendered HTML and progressive enhancement
- Build rich interactions without shipping a massive SPA

For the hybrid, htmx means:

- Prototype by editing templates, not wiring up a full client-side app
- Keep the mental model close to the browser: requests, responses, HTML updates
- Stay in your comfort zone—typography, layout, flow—while still shipping dynamic features

Both tools **lower the complexity tax** on turning a design idea into production code. That's the key.

## Taking Back Control Over Complexity

One subtle superpower of this hybrid role: **control over complexity**.

We've somehow normalised:

- Multi-megabyte JavaScript bundles for trivial UIs
- Deep npm trees for even simple components
- Build systems that need their own architecture diagrams

The designer–engineer hybrid, armed with AI + Svelte/htmx, can push back:

- Reach for server-rendered HTML when possible
- Use minimal components instead of entire UI libraries "just in case"
- Ask AI for *simpler* implementations, not just more layers

You still end up in npm hell sometimes. This isn't utopia. But you regain the ability to say:

> "No, let's not do that. There's a simpler pattern that gets us the same experience."

That's not a full solution to web bloat—but it's meaningful leverage.

## Designers Owning More of the Product

Here's what excites me most:

- Designers aren't limited to Figma and slide decks anymore
- They can **own the experience end-to-end**: behaviour, layout, performance, flows
- They can test ideas with real working UI, not just clickable prototypes

We're already seeing:

- Designers who ship small features directly as Svelte components
- Product designers who maintain htmx-enhanced template libraries
- Teams where "handoff" becomes "pairing on the actual code"

AI acts as a multiplier here:

- It fills in boilerplate
- It fixes syntax
- It offers patterns so designers don't have to memorise every API

But the human still decides what the experience should *feel* like. That part doesn't get automated.

## The New Power Role

The designer–engineer hybrid isn't a fantasy job description. It's a natural consequence of:

- Tools that respect the web's original simplicity (Svelte, htmx, plain HTML/CSS/JS)
- AI that makes translation from intent to code dramatically cheaper
- Teams that value speed, coherence, and ownership over strict silos

This role looks a lot like a modern, opinionated version of the old webmaster:

- Deep empathy for users and aesthetics
- Enough engineering skill (and AI leverage) to ship real features
- A strong sense of when complexity is necessary—and when it's just noise

For people who enjoy both design *and* code, these are incredibly good years to be working on the web. The stack is powerful. The tools are mature. The path from vision to reality has never been more direct.

And the best part?

You don't have to choose between "real engineer" and "just a designer" anymore. You can be the person who makes the thing.

That's where the leverage is. 🙃
