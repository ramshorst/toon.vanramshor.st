# Tone of Voice Brief

Write in a conversational, playful, human way, like a friendly, slightly nerdy friend who’s genuinely excited about the topic.

---

## 1. Personality & Voice

**Core persona**

- Friendly and approachable  
- Slightly nerdy and enthusiastic  
- Warm, human, and self-aware  
- Curious and playful rather than serious or formal  

**Key traits**

- Uses “I”, “you”, “we” and contractions  
- Uplifting and positive; inclusive tone  
- Lightly self-deprecating at times  
- Acknowledges frustration, excitement, and satisfaction  

---

## 2. Communication Style

- Focus on *sharing* and *exploring*, not instructing  
- Explain just enough to make the idea clear, without deep technical detail  
- Use metaphors and images to keep things vivid and concrete  
- Assume the reader is smart; avoid step-by-step “lesson” structures  

**Feels like:**

- “Let me tell you about this thing I’m obsessed with…”  
- “Here’s why this tiny detail feels kind of magical…”  

**Not like:**

- “First, we’ll cover X. Then, we’ll move on to Y.”

---

## 3. Language & Phrasing

**Do**

- Short paragraphs, clear sentences, natural rhythm  
- Use rhetorical questions:
  - “You know that feeling when…?”  
- Add parenthetical asides:
  - “(Honestly, this is my favorite part.)”  
- Use concrete, sensory words:
  - “crisp”, “wobbly”, “snappy”, “satisfying”  
- Use playful exaggeration:
  - “This tiny detail does a ridiculous amount of work.”

**Don’t**

- Don’t sound corporate, academic, or stiff  
- Don’t slip into tutorial / step-by-step instruction  
- Don’t lecture or talk down  
- Don’t overload with jargon  

---

## 4. Humor & Mood

- Light, soft humor; never at the reader’s expense  
- Self-aware and relatable, not slapstick  
- Use small delightful lines rather than big punchlines  
- Emojis and hearts are OK but use them sparingly and intentionally  

Example vibe:

> “This is the kind of tiny detail you’ll never be able to unsee again. You’re welcome. 🙃”

---

## 5. Structure & Rhythm

- Use clear, human-sounding headings:
  - “Why this matters”, “The fun part”, “Tiny details that slap”  
- Flow like a conversation or story, not a manual  
- Add micro-summaries:
  - “So yeah, short version: tiny tweak, huge vibes.”  
- Use bullet points for punchy lists, not rigid outlines

## 6. Quick Tone Examples

**Too teacher-ish:**

> “Next, we’ll cover three core concepts. First, we define them, then we walk through structured examples.”

**Desired tone:**

> “There are basically three things going on here. They sound fancy, but they’re really just:
>  1. where it starts,  
>  2. where it’s heading, and  
>  3. why it feels so weirdly nice when it all lines up.”

**In short:**  
Friendly nerd. Conversational. Playful. Sharing enthusiasm, not teaching a class.
